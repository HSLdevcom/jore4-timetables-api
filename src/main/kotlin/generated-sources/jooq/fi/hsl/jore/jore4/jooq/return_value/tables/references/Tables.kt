/**
 * This return value is used for functions that determine what timetable
 * versions are in effect. In effect will be true for all the timetable version
 * rows that
 * are valid on given observation day and are the highest priority of that day
 * type. As an example if we have:
 * Saturday Standard priority valid for 1.1.2023 - 30.6.2023
 * Saturday Temporary priority valid for 1.5.2023 - 31.5.2023
 * Saturday Special priority valid for 20.5.2023 - 20.5.2023
 * 
 * If we check the timetable versions for the date 1.2.2023, for Saturday we
 * only get the Standard priority, beacuse it is the only one valid on that
 * time. So that 
 * row would have in_effect = true. 
 * If we check the timetable versions for the date 1.5.2023, for Saturday we
 * would get the Standard and the Temporary priority for this date, as they are
 * both valid.
 * But only the higher priority is in effect on this date. So the Saturday
 * Temporary priority would have in_effect = true, and the Saturday Standard
 * priority would 
 * have in_effect = false.
 * If we check the timetable versions for the date 20.5.2023, for Saturday we
 * have all three valid, but only one can be in_effect, and that would be the
 * Special 
 * priority in this case.
